# Sandbox

This is a practice sandbox project and it's to test the clone, push and pull features.

* I cloned this repository and then try to push it back.
* I copy the public SSH key to GitHub.  
* I was able to sucessfully pulled the repo from GitHub using SHH key. 
* I editted the readme.md file and successfully pushed it back the Github using SSH key.
